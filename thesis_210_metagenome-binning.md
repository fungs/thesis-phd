## Metagenome binning

Functional screenings of metagenomes for new enzymes [@UfarteDiscovery2015], which are mainly driven by biotechnological and medical applications, focus on the identificaiton of the proteins. Though, when studying protein-coding genes and their regulation in more detail, it is often beneficial to extract the corresponding genomes to understand the genomic context. One way to retrieve a full genome sequence is by direct physical extraction from the environment or from enrichment cultures. However, the sorting of cells is difficult as there may be hundreds or thousands of different species, or operational taxonomic units (OTUs), in a metagenomic sample [@HessMetagenomic2011; @WoykeAssembling2009; @WoykeOne2010]. The required cultivation conditions, which are needed to produce clone libraries, are also often unknown or difficult to reproduce. Finally, direct sequencing of extracted cells may not be possible due to the limited amount of input DNA. For these reasons, *in-silico* metagenomic methods provide a good alternative. Metagenome sequence binning is the algorithmic approach for reconstructing individual genomes from shotgun metagenome sequence data. In a simple definition, a genome bin is a set of sequences, usually assembled contigs, which all-together are believed to present the sequenced part of a specific community genome. The capturing of these genomes allows studying taxa on the level of genes and their associated functions. For an extensive introduction to metagenome binning, see the review article [@DrogeTaxonomic2012] in the appendix of this thesis.

### Binning methodology

There are many different algorithmic approaches to infer genome bins and most of them are either a form of data clustering or classification, including hybrid methods. The major difference between these two approaches is that clustering is a so-called unsupervised method, which does not directly take into account external information like available genome sequences. The strength of clustering is that it can group any data to explore their intrinsic structure, being able to group contigs of genomes which have never been seen before. In contrast, classification algorithms utilize categorized data, for instance large genome sequence collections, to assign sequences to genome bins. They are said to operate in a supervised manner. Due to the use of additional information, they can be very efficient but a major drawback is the difficulty to handle novel genomes. Since clustering and classification methods complement each other, it is common to combine them in one or another way, for instance classifying genome bins after clustering or initializing clusters using classification labels [@ImelfortGroopm2014].

### Sequence features

Binning methods can also be categorized by the kind of information they use. Both clustering or classification methods for binning operate on sequence (contig) features. These are properties which inform about genome membership and discriminate contigs of different genomes. Gnoenomes expose a characteristic frequency distribution of short nucleotide motifs [@KarlinCompositional1997] which is generally called the nucleotide composition and often used in binning. The simplest form to measure nucleotide composition is the combined relative frequency of guanine and cytosine nucleotides (GC-content), an evolutionary trait of genomes that has long been used to characterize different species. For instance, most Actinobacteria expose a high GC-content. Many methods, however, use short nucleotide motifs consisting of 4 to 7 bases called $k$-mers ($k$ stands for the number of bases). Alternative formulations may use Hidden Markow Models (HMMs) to describe nucleotide composition [@BradyPhymm2009]. A second major feature type for binning is the amount of sequencing reads covering each assembled contig. Read assembly works by aligning reads which overlap with others so that each nucleotide position of a resulting contig must be covered by at least a single read, but typically many more. Following random shotgun sequencing with universal primers, the expected number of reads covering a single position is approximately proportional to the genome copy number in the sequenced sample, with a constant factor which depends on the total sequencing effort. Contig coverage information thus helps to discriminate genomes with distinct sample abundances, but cannot differentiate between equally abundant genomes. Hence, it is desirable to generate multiple metagenome samples of a community for which the genome copy numbers vary differently so that each genome has a unique set of genome abundances. This requires a corresponding experimental setup before the metagenome of the microbial community is sequenced. Recent studies have shown that genome abundances represent a very informative feature type to obtain genome bins for complex metagenomes, if many varying samples are available [@AlbertsenGenome2013; @AlnebergBinning2014]. Sometimes, binning programs may also employ assembly information such as associated contigs or scaffolds linked by paired reads [@LuCocacola2016], but such information, if available, is more frequently used to link, quality-check or refine genome bins after binning [@PatilTaxonomic2011].

There is a specific class of homology-based classifiers, and an example of such a method is described in [@sec:synopsis_taxator-tk]. These methods employ a two-step procedure, first identifying potential homologs for a contig, for instance by alignment to reference sequences, and second determining a corresponding evolutionary neighborhood. This neighborhood is usually reported by taxon so that each contig is annotated with a taxonomic path. When contigs are grouped by taxa and those paths lead down to the species or strain level, then these groups can be viewed as incomplete genome bins. However, higher-level taxon bins mix contigs from several genomes, if the sample contains more than a single member of this clade. Hence, taxonomic classification using sequence similarity can only provide a partial solution to the binning problem. However, taxonomic annotation also informs about the phylogenetic sample composition and diversity, similar to a 16S analysis, and may be used as secondary features for unsupervised methods, for instance to initialize genome clusters [@ImelfortGroopm2014] or to train a classification model with sample data [@GregorPhylopythias2016]. The binning framework presented in [@sec:synopsis_mglex] utilizes taxon annotation as features for binning similarly to nucleotide composition and contig coverage information.

### Advantages and disadvantages of binning approaches

Multiple factors, such as the number and abundances of taxa, their phylogenetic structure, availability of reference genome sequences and computing resources have an impact on binning performance. While homology-based methods can assign individual reads at the species level in some cases, this is not usually the case and read assignment is notably less accurate than contig assignment. Also, the run-time for the sequence similarity search is determined by a product of the query sequence and the reference sequence lengths, which can be very high for unassembled metagenomic read data. Using nucleotide composition instead of homology for classification requires less data and time both for model training and for sequence classification, which scales linearly with the sample size. When compared to clustering methods, the accuaracy of classification methods based on sequence composition also depends on the availability of reference data. Generally, clustering allows resolving bins which would go undetected by classification and has no need for training data.

### Binning programs

Binning programs emerged and evolved together with metagenome sequencing and assembly, so that their focus changes according to current protocols. Recent programs for complex communities target long (1 kb or more) assembled contigs but some programs were also designed to bin raw sequencing reads [@VinhTwophase2015; @UlyantsevMetafast2016], for instance by comparison to genome sequence collections or nucleotide composition. Since the latter is unstable for sequences with only a few hundreds of bases [@MchardyAccurate2007], these programs are inherently limited to simple communities and community members which have related genome sequences available for comparison. Most newer binning programs with applications to complex metagenomes, which are listed in [@tbl:binning_programs], operate on co-assembled contigs, which are constructed using multiple sequenced community samples.

### State of the art

Clearly, an optimal binning would mean to obtain a single bin for each genome in the community. Suboptimal solutions may contain either multiple smaller bins for a genome or bins with mixed contigs of different genomes. While the original objective is indisputable, it is impossible to obtain the optimal partition for real metagenome data if there is not enough information to discriminate the contigs, especially shorter ones. There are many binning methods which all produce suboptimal bins and there is no clear agreement in the metagenomics community of how to rate and compare the bins obtained by different methods. Initiatives such as the [Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI)](http://cami-challenge.org/) work towards establishing a common understanding to judge metagenome binning. Different views exist because the binning quality is determined by its utility in downstream processing, which in turn depends on the specific research questions. For instance, the estimation of community structure might require an equally biased construction of adequately sized bins whereas someone interested in a few species genomes will probably tolerate a certain fraction of pollution in the corresponding bins and neglect the contigs contained in other bins. Therefore, the methods are best judged in the context of their use cases.

Binning algorithms are also sensitive to the nature of the data so that a method which appears to work well for one ecosystem might largely fail for another one because it is confronted with a completely different metagenome with regard to the number and abundances of genomes and their sequence content. This problem is most pronounced for methods which represent instances of classification algorithms, for which external genome sequence data is used to group the sample contigs. Communities linked to medical applications, for example human gut microbiota, are usually well suited to the classification approach because there are abundant genome data for microbes related to human health. On the contrary, the analysis of a deep sea vent community is likely too exotic for plain classification.

The broad range of applications involving many different microbial habitats, custom experimental techniques and heterogeneous sequencing platforms makes it difficult to define a state of the art for binning. Nonetheless, general trends can be observed. Recent works which have presented genome bins derived from complex metagenomes often applied clustering in concatenated and transformed feature spaces [@ImelfortGroopm2014; @AlnebergBinning2014; @KangMetabat2015; @LinAccurate2016]. These multi-dimensional spaces integrate several types of features including nucleotide composition and contig coverage for multiple samples. However, the derivation of high-quality draft genomes still relies on manual analysis and processing of genome bins [@AlbertsenGenome2013; @ErenAnvi2015].
