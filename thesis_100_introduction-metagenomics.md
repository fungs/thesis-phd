## Metagenomics for Dummies

Metagenomics is a younger speciality of genomics that applies recent nucleotide sequencing technologies to answer medical or ecological questions at the scale of microbial communities. While genomics is focused on the genomes of single species that are traditionally grown in lab cultures before sequencing, the metagenomic approach is based on sampling from a natural ecosystem without cultivation. If DNA is extracted and sequenced directly after sampling, the resulting sequence data comprise genes of the enire microbial community. To decribe this mix of genomes, the term metagenome was first coined by []. One could say, that doing metagenomics trades species-level genomic resolution for a more complete, wholistic view on the genes in a natural environment.

## How did metagenomics evolve

Metagenomics can be described as a best-effort approach that is tightly coupled to the development of next-generation sequencing technology (NGS). At the beginning, when
